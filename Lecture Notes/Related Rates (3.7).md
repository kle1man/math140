## Section 3.7: Related Rates

### Lecture Notes

Each variable (distance, length, radius, height, volume, etc.) is a function of time. We'll use implicit differentiation to find an unknown rate of change. We'll use given rates of change, given values, and our own prior knowledge (area formulas, volume formulas, etc.).

Steps (from p. 182 of the textbook):

1. Identify and label the different variables. Include the variable whose rate is to be evaluated and those whose rates are given. It may be helpful to sketch a drawing at this stage.

2. Find an equation relating the variables whose rates of change are known and the variable whose rate of change is desired. This may involve similar triangles, the Pythagorean Theorem, or trigonometric identities.

3. Differentiate both sides of the equation, either by using the chain rule or by differentiating implicitly, in order to find a relation between the rates of change.

4. Solve for the desired rate of change by using the given values of the variables and their rates.
