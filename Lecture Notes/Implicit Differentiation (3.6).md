## Section 3.6: Implicit Differentiation

### Lecture Notes

If we're given an equation involving both $x$ and $y$ for which we cannot isolate (solve for) $y$, we say $y$ is implicitly a function of $x$.

Our goal will be to find $\frac{dy}{dx}$ where $y$ is implicitly a function of $x$. This is called implicit differentiation.

Method:

1. Keep in mind that "$y$ is a function of $x$" ($y=f(x)$).

2. Every time you take a derivative of a $y$-term, multiply it by $\frac{dy}{dx}$.

3. Take the derivative of BOTH sides of the equation.

4. Solve algebraically for $\frac{dy}{dx}$.
