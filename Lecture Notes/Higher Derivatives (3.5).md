## Section 3.5: Higher Derivatives

### Lecture Notes

*Professor Williams didn't give notes for this section, he just did examples because the topic is quite self-explanatory. Deriving the idea from his examples, I wrote up the following notes:*

A higher derivative is found through the repeated process of taking the derivative of the derivative.

$f'(x)$ = the first derivative

$f''(x)$ = the second derivative (found by taking the derivative of the function given by the first derivative)

$f'''(x)$ = the third derivative (found by taking the derivative of the function given by the second derivative)

Technically, this process continues (you could take a fifth derivative, assuming the original function allows it), but realistically you will never encounter anything more than a third derivative on a math problem (at least in this class).
