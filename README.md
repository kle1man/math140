## MATH 140

A repository of lecture notes for the University of Maryland's Calculus I course (MATH 140), taken in the Spring semester of 2024 with Professor Kendall Williams.

Notes are taken from a combination of Professor Williams' in-person lectures and live recordings.

Examples are pulled by Professor Williams from the textbook (Calculus with Concepts in Calculus 6th ed., by Robert Ellis and Denny Gulick).
